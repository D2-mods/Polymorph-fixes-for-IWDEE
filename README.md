Download: https://github.com/D2-mods/Polymorph-fixes-for-IWDEE/releases  
Installs on: IWD:EE (tested on v2.5 and v2.6)  
Languages: English, Russian (yota13)


#### Components (v1.9.2):
1. Polymorph fixes for IWD:EE
2. Patch for nymph.BCS (fixes crash with EEex)
3. Make movement rate bonuses of polymorph forms more consistent
4. Increase movement speed of Winter Wolf and Polar Bear forms
5. Uncap Crippling Strike (capped at -7 in v2.5 and v2.6.6)
6. Patch shortbows to use shortbow visuals (as in classic IWD)


#### Install info:
- All components can be installed independently and in any order.
- The main fixes component assumes that you are using vanilla Shapechange forms, so by its nature, it will conflict with any mod that alters these forms.
- The movement rate components should be compatible with anything, as long as file names are unchanged.
