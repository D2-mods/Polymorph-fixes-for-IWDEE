Game version: IWD:EE v2.5 and v2.6, and possibly older versions (untested)


WHAT THIS MOD DOES:

Fixes stats of some polymorphs and edits descriptions of Shapechange forms to all share the same layout. The descriptions for fire/earth elemental now also list the correct resistances (identical to Druid forms). Also makes minor changes to the Mind Flayer's Psionic Blast.


INSTALL INFO:

Copy zip contents to game directory and run setup-d2-iwdee-fixes.exe. You have the option to patch or copy files to the override. To uninstall, just run the setup again. By its nature, this mod will conflict with any mod that makes changes to polymorph stats.


FIXES/TWEAKS:

Polymorph Self
- Winter Wolf, Boring Beetle, and Polar Bear are no longer permanently hasted

Shapechange (all changed to match descriptions)
- Giant Troll Strength changed from 18 to 18/00
- Water Elemental weapon damage changed from 1d8 to 4d8

Text edits:
- all Shapechange forms

Psionic Blast
- added missing description for v2.5
- uses IWDEE v2.6 version as a base, with a few changes:
1. stun duration changed to 5 rounds (from 10) to match description
2. ability regenerates when used (this just skips the extra step of needing to re-shapechange into a Mind Flayer if you wanted to use Psionic Blast more than once)
3. added back the orb thing over a stunned creature
