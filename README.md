# Polymorph (and other) fixes for IWD:EE
Download: https://github.com/D2-mods/Polymorph-fixes-for-IWDEE/releases  
Installs on: IWD:EE (tested on v2.5 and v2.6)


#### Components (v1.5):
1. Polymorph fixes for IWD:EE
2. Patch for nymph.BCS (fixes crash with EEex)
3. Make movement rate bonuses of polymorph forms more consistent
4. Increase movement speed of Winter Wolf and Polar Bear forms


#### Install info:
- All components can be installed independently and in any order.
- The main fixes component assumes that you are using vanilla Shapechange forms, so by its nature, it will conflict with any mod that alters these forms.
- The movement rate components should be compatible with anything, as long as file names are unchanged.
